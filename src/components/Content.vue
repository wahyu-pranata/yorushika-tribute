        Yorushika (ヨルシカ) is a Japanese rock duo debuted in 2017, composed of
        two amazing and secretive members: N-buna, a former vocaloid music
        producer and Suis, a female vocalist. They haven't revealed their faces
        in the public nor the media, but they held 2 concerts, in July 2017 and
        August 2019.

      <p class="intro-content-paragraph">
        The name "Yorushika" was taken from a lyric in their song "Kumo to
        Yūrei" (The Clouds and the Ghost), the line "Yoru shika mō nemurezu ni"
        which translates to, "I can only sleep at night." Their logo mark is a
        motif of two moons facing each other and also serves as a clock hand,
        portraying the time "from 6:00 to night".
